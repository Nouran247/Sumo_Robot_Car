# ü§ñ Sumo Car Robot Project

## Overview
This project presents a fully functional **Sumo Robot**, built to compete in robot sumo competitions where autonomous or remote-controlled robots attempt to push each other out of a circular ring. Our design combines **mechanical precision**, **advanced electronics**, and **wireless control** for agile and intelligent performance.

The robot features a custom 3D-printed chassis, obstacle detection using IR sensors, and wireless Bluetooth control via a PlayStation controller ‚Äî all powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller**.

## üöÄ Features

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 for wireless communication and logic handling.
- **Wireless Control**: Bluetooth-enabled PlayStation controller for remote control.
- **Motion Control**: Two high-torque DC motors with L298 motor driver.
- **Obstacle Detection**: IR sensors for opponent and edge detection.
- **Chassis**: Custom 3D-printed design, optimized for strength and low weight.
- **Battery Powered**: Supports 3S or 4S LiPo battery for high-performance mobility.
- **Modular Assembly**: Designed with individual parts for easy maintenance and upgrades.
